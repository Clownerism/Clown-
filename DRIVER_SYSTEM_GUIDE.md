# Driver Delivery System Documentation

## Overview

The Driver Delivery System is a comprehensive solution that extends your Laravel e-commerce application with real delivery functionality. It provides drivers with tools to manage deliveries, update order status, and collect Cash on Delivery (COD) payments.

## Features

### 🚛 Driver Dashboard

-   **Statistics Overview**: Total assigned orders, pending deliveries, orders delivered today, and pending COD collections
-   **Active Orders Management**: View and update orders that are assigned, out for delivery, or pending
-   **Order History**: View previously completed deliveries (delivered or failed)
-   **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard auto-refreshes to show latest order assignments

### 📱 Driver Capabilities

-   **Status Updates**: Change delivery status between:
    -   `Assigned` - Order assigned to driver
    -   `Out for Delivery` - Driver is en route to deliver
    -   `Delivered` - Successfully delivered to customer
    -   `Failed` - Delivery attempt failed
-   **COD Collection**: Mark Cash on Delivery payments as collected
-   **Delivery Notes**: Add notes about delivery attempts or special instructions
-   **Bulk Operations**: Update multiple orders simultaneously

### 🔐 Security Features

-   **Role-based Access**: Custom `CheckDriver` middleware ensures only drivers can access driver routes
-   **Order Ownership**: Drivers can only view and update orders assigned to them
-   **Validation**: Proper validation for status updates and payment collection

## Usage Guide

### For Administrators

#### 1. Creating Driver Users

Drivers can be created through the existing user management system with `role = 'driver'` or using the seeder:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=DriverSeeder
```

This creates sample drivers:

-   John Driver (john.driver@example.com)
-   Jane Delivery (jane.delivery@example.com)
-   Mike Transport (mike.transport@example.com)

#### 2. Assigning Orders to Drivers

-   Navigate to Admin Dashboard → Orders
-   Click "Edit" on any order
-   Select a driver from the "Assign Driver" dropdown
-   Order status automatically changes to "Assigned"

### For Drivers

#### 1. Accessing the Driver Portal

-   Login with driver credentials
-   Navigate to `/driver/dashboard` or click "Dashboard" after login
-   The system automatically redirects drivers to their dashboard

#### 2. Managing Deliveries

-   **View Active Orders**: See all orders assigned to you that need delivery
-   **Update Status**: Click "Update Status" to change delivery status
-   **COD Collection**: For COD orders, check "Cash Collected" when payment is received
-   **Add Notes**: Include delivery notes for customer service or future reference

#### 3. Today's Deliveries

-   Click "Today's Deliveries" to see orders scheduled for today
-   Quick access to order details and status updates
-   Optimized view for mobile devices

### For Customers

-   **Order Tracking**: Customers can see delivery status and assigned driver in their order details
-   **Real-time Updates**: Order status updates reflect immediately in customer accounts

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Orders table includes:
delivery_status ENUM('Pending', 'Assigned', 'Out for Delivery', 'Delivered', 'Failed')
driver_id INT NULL (foreign key to users table)
payment_status ENUM('pending', 'paid', 'failed')
delivered_at TIMESTAMP NULL
```

### Key Routes

```php
// Driver Dashboard
GET /driver/dashboard

// Order Management
GET /driver/orders/{order}        // View order details
PUT /driver/orders/{order}        // Update order status
GET /driver/todays-deliveries     // Today's deliveries
POST /driver/orders/bulk-update   // Bulk status updates
```

### Middleware

-   `CheckDriver` middleware protects all driver routes
-   Registered as `'driver'` alias in `bootstrap/app.php`

### Controllers

-   `DriverOrderController` handles all driver functionality
-   Includes validation, authorization, and business logic
-   Supports bulk operations and filtering

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

Ensure your Laravel application has:

1. ✅ User authentication (Laravel Breeze/Fortify)
2. ✅ Role-based access control
3. ✅ Order management system
4. ✅ Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS for styling

### Required Relationships

```php
// User Model
public function isDriver() { return $this->role === 'driver'; }
public function driverOrders() { return $this->hasMany(Order::class, 'driver_id'); }

// Order Model
public function driver() { return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'driver_id'); }
```

## Testing

### Sample Workflow

1. **Admin**: Create an order through the customer interface
2. **Admin**: Assign the order to a driver via admin panel
3. **Driver**: Login and see the order in their dashboard
4. **Driver**: Update status to "Out for Delivery"
5. **Driver**: Mark as "Delivered" and collect COD if applicable
6. **Customer**: See updated delivery status in their account

### Test Data

Run the DriverSeeder to create test users:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=DriverSeeder
```

## API Endpoints

### Driver Dashboard

-   `GET /driver/dashboard` - Main dashboard with statistics and active orders

### Order Management

-   `GET /driver/orders/{id}` - View specific order details
-   `PUT /driver/orders/{id}` - Update order status/payment
-   `POST /driver/orders/bulk-update` - Update multiple orders

### Validation Rules

```php
// Status Update
'delivery_status' => 'required|in:Assigned,Out for Delivery,Delivered,Failed'
'cash_collected' => 'nullable|boolean'
'delivery_notes' => 'nullable|string|max:500'

// Bulk Update
'order_ids' => 'required|array'
'order_ids.*' => 'exists:orders,id'
'status' => 'required|in:Out for Delivery,Delivered,Failed'
```

## UI/UX Features

-   **Optimized Queries**: Efficient database queries with proper relationships

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Driver Can't Access Dashboard

-   **Check**: User role is set to 'driver'
-   **Check**: CheckDriver middleware is registered
-   **Check**: Routes are properly defined

#### 2. Orders Not Showing

-   **Check**: Orders have driver_id set to the logged-in driver
-   **Check**: Delivery status is not 'Delivered' or 'Failed' for active orders

#### 3. Status Updates Failing

-   **Check**: Validation rules are met
-   **Check**: Driver owns the order being updated
-   **Check**: CSRF token is included in forms

#### 4. COD Payment Not Working

-   **Check**: Order payment_method is 'cash_on_delivery'
-   **Check**: Payment status is 'pending'
-   **Check**: Checkbox is properly named 'cash_collected'
